*PROJECT TITLE*

*ESP32-DevKit-V1 Custom Board with Regulated Power Supply & Mode Selector*
 
## Project Description

This project is a custom-designed printed circuit board (PCB) based on the ESP32-DevKit-V1 development module. It is designed for embedded systems, IoT prototyping, and general electronics engineering use. The board includes a complete 5V regulated power supply circuit using the AMS1117-5.0 voltage regulator, input power jack, main power switch, and a DPDT slide switch for selecting between two operating modes or signal paths. The layout follows best practices: proper power filtering, stable regulation, short direct traces, clear ground planes, and all GPIO pins broken out to standard headers — making it a reliable, compact, and fully functional development platform.

## Features

* ESP32-DevKit-V1 compatible design
